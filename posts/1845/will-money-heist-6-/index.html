In an interview in 2020, he said that he had plans for a sixth season and that the team was considering whether to do it as a movie or as a series.\nThe second piece of evidence pointing towards a sixth season of Money Heist is the amount of money it has earned since its first season. The fourth season of Money Heist ended with tremendous success, becoming the most watched show in the world. This success could be a sign that Money Heist is still popular, and that it has potential to come out with a sixth season.\nThe third piece of evidence indicating a sixth season of Money Heist is the ongoing demand of the series from fans. It has been two years since the airing of its fourth season, and fans are still asking for more Money Heist content. If the demand for the series continues, the creators of Money Heist may be more inclined to continue the story and release a sixth season.\nIn conclusion, the possibility of a sixth season of Money Heist still remains open.

The series has four seasons with the fourth season ending on May 3, 2020. Since then, fans have been eagerly waiting for the next season. While Netflix has not officially announced the renewal of the series for a sixth season, there are still possibilities of Money Heist season 6.\nThe series was renewed for its fourth season right after its third season in November 2019. This could mean that due to the show’s popularity, Netflix might renew the series for a sixth season. Also, the creator of the show, Alex Pina, has hinted that he has plans for Money Heist season 6. So, he could already have started working on the story for the next season.\nAnother reason why Money Heist season 6 is likely is that the cast of the show are all interested in returning for the next season.

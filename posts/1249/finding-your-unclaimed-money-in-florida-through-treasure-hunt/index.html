This money may have been created from forgotten bank accounts, contents in abandoned safe deposit boxes, and insurance benefits that have gone unclaimed. This article will provide an overview of Florida’s unclaimed money policy and how to use the Treasure Hunt program to find your money.\nThe state of Florida has set up the “Treasure Hunt” program to help Floridians claim their unclaimed money.

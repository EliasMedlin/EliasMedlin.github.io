The state of Florida has created a program that allows individuals to search for unclaimed money and valuables that have been lost or forgotten. Claiming your found money and treasures is a straightforward process, beginning with searching the property database. The official website of the state of Florida provides the search engine so that you can easily locate any unclaimed money or property that you are entitled to. Once you have located the property of interest, you need to download the claim form from the website and fill it out accurately. You will need to provide proof of ownership and identification along with the completed form. The form, along with supporting documentation, needs to be submitted to the Department of Financial Services. Depending on the value of the treasure or money, the claim will be processed within 15 to 120 days. After the claim is approved, you will receive the found money or treasure in the mail.</p><h3 id=2-claiming-your-found-money-and-treasures-in-florida>2.

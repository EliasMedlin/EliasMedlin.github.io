How to Avoid Unclaimed Money Scams It’s important to be aware of unclaimed money scams when you’re dealing with unclaimed money resources. Don’t be a victim of fraud by following these guidelines when researching unclaimed money. First, always be wary of anyone who contacts you out of the blue and tries to help you get money you never knew about but that’s supposedly owed to you. Second, don’t pay any money up front for help to collect unclaimed money. Reputable organizations, such as unclaimed money departments of state governments, never charge fees to help you find and collect unclaimed money.

Be sure to research any organization you are considering using thoroughly, verifying that it’s in good standing with the Better Business Bureau and determining if there are any customer complaints against them. Additionally, never pay upfront fees to reclaim your money; real unclaimed money-finding services are always free.\nBeware of companies that promise a specific amount of money that’s been left unclaimed or guarantee to locate money for you. These are common signs of a scam. Also, if a company suddenly contacts you claiming to have found unclaimed money with your name on it, do not be fooled—this too is a trick.\nAvoid services that require you to provide credit card information or a Social Security number to receive your unclaimed money—this sort of information should never be necessary. Lastly, never sign any documents without reading them thoroughly and understanding what you are agreeing to.\nWhen searching for unclaimed money, remember to use only credible, well-known services.

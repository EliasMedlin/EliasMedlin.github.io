Under Texas law, a person who is in lawful possession of an unclaimed property may take ownership of the property without the need to file a claim for it. When this occurs, the property is considered to be abandoned and the law allows the person to take title to the property without interference from the original owner.\nThe Texas Unclaimed Property Act (UPA) outlines the process that must be followed in order to acquire abandoned property. The UPA also outlines the rules for declaring a property as abandoned and the methods for handling a claim for the unclaimed property. The UPA ensures that all parties involved are afforded due process and that the property is not disposed of without the consent of the owner.\nIn addition, the Texas Unclaimed Property law requires the Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts to administer the UPA. The Comptroller is responsible for ensuring that abandoned property is properly accounted for and that the rightful owner is given the opportunity to reclaim it. The Comptroller also has the authority to enforce the law and to impose penalties when necessary.\nLastly, Texas law allows anyone in possession of unclaimed property to file a civil suit to force the original owner to relinquish his or her rights to the property. Civil suits may involve a variety of legal arguments, including the fact that the property was abandoned and the original owner has failed to take action to reclaim it. In any case, the suit must be conducted in accordance with the Texas Unclaimed Property Act.\nII.
